# A. Introduction to the 2019 Summer Krill Experiment

#### A.1 Introduction & Aquarium:
Adult krill, Euphausia pacifica, were introduced to the Mobile Ocean Acidification Treatment System (MOATS) on 09SEP19-11SEP19. Krill were collected the evenings of September 9th and 10th. The system was supplied with flowing seawater from Puget Sound filtered to 1 µm, UV sterilized, and maintained at 12°C. Seawater was degassed upstream of the individual MOATs. Carbon dioxide, oxygen, and nitrogen added to each MOATs under real-time feedback control system using LabView Software (version needed) with Honeywell Durafet III pH and Vernier optical dissolved oxygen probes and Omega thermistors. Semi-diurnal flow control governed with solenoid valve to the upper, animal acrylic box.  Flow rate 53 L/hr.

#### A.1.a Aquarium Diagram:
Simple graphic of the MOATS assembly is shown above. The krill lived in the inner acrylic 44L box at the top of the assembly. The acrylic box's temperature was controlled with "jacket" water insulating the animal, acrylic box. The jacket water flow was constant from the lower "system-control" box. The lower box represents the location of the probes, governing the temperature and water chemistry of each replicate.

#### A.2 Collection:
The September 9th, 2019 collection occurred at evening low tide, slack water, occurred at 2046. 
Nautical Twilight concluded at 2022, with Civil Twilight concluding at 1955. Sunset happened at 1932. Boat was launched at 1940. Boat on-station IVO 47.982569, -122.307623 at approximately 2030.  50meters of cable scope was deployed at a speed of 1.5-2knots to achieve a towing depth of approximately 25meters. Five of ten tows produced suitable sized krill ( x>.0250, x<.0650).

The September 10th, 2019 collection occurred at evening low tide, slack water, occurred at 2121. Nautical Twilight concluded at 2021, with Civil Twilight concluding at 1954. Sunset happened at 1931. Boat was launched at 2015. Boat on-station IVO 47.982569, -122.307623 at approximately 2100. Tows were similar in scope and duration to September 9th , 2019.

#### A.2.b Sorting:
09SEP19 25-krill were stocked between moats. 10SEP19 60 to 65-krill were stocked between MOATs to bring the project start totals to the MOATs as follows:
MOATs 01- 85 | MOATs 02- 85 | MOATs 03- 80 | MOATs 04- 80 | 		
MOATs 05- 80 | MOATs 06- 80 | MOATs 07- 80 | MOATs 08- 80 | 		
MOATs 10- 80 | MOATs 11- 80 | MOATs 12- 80 | MOATs 13- 80 |


![Graph 2: Replicate MOATS Lab Setup](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/NWFSC.MUK_KRL_SMR2019_ambientandbroken/04_Presentations/KRL.SMR.19.graphic1a_MOATS_systemdiagram.png)

#### A.2.c Initial Density:
Krill were held under acclimation conditions for 11-12 days and treatment conditions for 35-37 days. They were housed in 44L aquaria inside each replicate experimental treatment at an initial density of 80-85 krill per replicate (1.8 krill/L; ~ 3 g krill per replicate).


# B. Explanation of MOATs and Treatment Determination

#### B.1 Treatment Determination & Survival 
Krill Treatment determinations were made approximately on 19SEP19 and confirmed on 24SEP19 with the introduction of the ambient treatment. The division shown below was aimed to start the experiment with survival divided equally among MOATS.  


![Graphic 3: Acclimation Perod Survival Across all MOATS](/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/NWFSC.MUK_KRL_SMR2019_ambientandbroken/04_Presentations/AllMOATsSurvivalfollowingAccliminationPeriod copy.png)
#### B.1a Inital Treatment Determinations

# 1. Setting the Working Directory
1.0
Look for all files inside the Water Chemistry folder of the "06. MOATs replication verification" folder


```{r, setup, include=FALSE }
#*********************************
## 1.) Set working directory
#*********************************
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir =
                       "/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/NWFSC.MUK_KRL_SMR2019_ambientandbroken/01_Rawdata")

getwd()
setwd("/Users/katherinerovinski/GIT/NWFSC.MUK_KRL_SMR2019_ambientandbroken/01_Rawdata")
getwd()
```



#### 1.1 Initial Working Directoy

Inside the working directory (folder) is 1 CSV files generated after combining 13CSV logs representing 24second observations. These CSV files were created using the moats graph app

#### 1.1.2 Link to Generating App

[Link to moats.Graph.app](http://github.com/pmcelhany/moatsGraphs.git)
Moving average window (nObs) set to 4. 

#### 1.1.3 Protocol with app

Every 17th observations was selected, the observations were 24second apart. 

#### 1.1.4 App data for 13 MOATS

1 CSVs per moats: M01, M02, M03, M04, M05, M06, M07, M08, M09, M10, M11, M12, M13. Files are also available on the OA Google drive. [OA Drive for MOATS data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13a2hk1a9I9gRIgf2Xyl1dSYDf5vnyYvs)

### 1.2 Subsampling

For speed and ease of computations the dataframe was extermely subsampled. 
Instead of the standard "n17" used in the aquarium temperature investigation, this document subsampled at "n333".

#### 1.2.1 Subsampling explained by observations

All observations (per the 13 MOATS logs)
[1] 1137880   7 (6 seconds)
Number of observations after subsampling every 17th response/observation
[1] 66934     7 (24 seconds)
Number of observations after the super-subsampling, every 333rd observation
[1] 3417      7 (~30minutes) ***this won't detail the ramp


#### 1.2.2 Subsampling Determination

To examine the Day to Night ramp (D2Nramp) researcher used n17 subsampling group

#### 5.1 Three Treatments
Three treatments of this studies are identified as 
* "current" for the Current Conditions Treatment
* "hightemperature" for the High Temperature Conditions Treatment
* "allchange" for the All Change Conditions Treatment which incorporated both the high temperature conditions of the "hightemperature" treatment along with exposure to lower aquariun pH.

```

#### 5.1.1 Ambient Treatment
Those MOATS aquarium systems that did not reach desired/programed conditions were deemed the "ambient" treatment. No temperature, DO, or pH conditions were programmed or alarmed. Flow control was governed by a solenoid valve to acheive flow/no-flow, day/night periods. 

MOATS inside the "Ambient" treatment included MOATs 04 and MOATs 05 both were shown to have faulty thermisters. 

Recorded conditions of what the animals experienced can't be guaranteed/confirmed. 

Without a record of aquarium settings MOATs 04 and MOAT 05 data was not included. 



# 6.) Creating Night and Day Periods 

#### 6.1 Narrative (Overall)

```

#### 6.5.1 Quick Check on Day to Night Ramp Verification
The ramp verification will be important to dissolved oxygen verification
Dissolved oxygen not yet shown. 
Recorded dissolved oxygen needs to be corrected with observed salinity. 

The following 2 plots are only present to visualize the different periods across treatments

```{r  6.5.1a Quick Check on Day to Night Ramp Verification}

#### 8.2 Practical Salinity Units - Measurements Per Moats per Day
These observations consist of salinity measurements taken per MOATS per day.
The observation were recorded per MOATS per day as the researcher took point measurements from the aquarium box while doing DO measurements. 

```{r 8.2 Practical Salinity Units - Measurements Per Moats per Day}
# Manual Readings
# Per MOAT measurement
H2Ochemdf$PSUperMOATs <- all_salinity$salinity[match
                                               (paste
                                                 (H2Ochemdf$ObservationDate,

                                                   all_salinity$moats))]
```

#### 8.3 Practical Salinity Units - Daily Avg Measurement 
Manual records sometimes have holes
Monday through Friday averages were recorded with greater fidelity than weekend averages. 


```{r 8.3 Practical Salinity Units - Daily Avg Measurement}
# All MOATs daily
H2Ochemdf$PSUavgDaily <- all_salinity$salinity[match
                                               (paste
                                                 (H2Ochemdf$ObservationDate,'All'), 
                                                 paste
                                                 (all_salinity$PSU_ObsDate, 
                                                   all_salinity$moats), 
                                                 nomatch = NA_character_)]
```


#### 8.4 Practical Salinity Units - Previous Daily Avg Measurement 
DO point measurements occured weekly. 
Salinity averages were typically recorded every day, Monday- Friday.
Some DO measurements were a week apart. 
The previous daily average was thought to be a better reflection than the last per Day, per MOATs salinity measurement.

#### 8.4.1 Last Observation Carried Forward Function
(Description)
Generic function for replacing each NA with the most recent non-NA prior to it.

This function was used to cover those gaps that occured most weekends.

```{r 8.4 Practical Salinity Units - Previous Daily Avg Measurement}
# Previous All MOATs daily
H2Ochemdf$PSUprevObs <- na.locf(H2Ochemdf$PSUavgDaily, na.rm = FALSE)
```


#### 8.5 Practical Salinity Units - Assumed Salinity Value 
Before the start of the study, a salinity of 28.8PSU was observed the week prior to the study's start

```{r 8.5 Practical Salinity Units - Assumed Salinity Value}
 
H2Ochemdf$assumed_PSU <- 28.8

```

#### 8.6 Practical Salinity Units - Final Salinity Value 
cycling between different salinity measurements required moving between character based and numeric based functions.

# 9.0) Creating Percent Dissoved Oxy Value 

The Library wql is required for the following chunk 
The package name stands for ``water quality'' and reflects the # original focus on time series data for physical and chemical # properties of water, as well as the biota. Intended for # programs that sample approximately monthly, quarterly or # annually at discrete stations, a feature of many legacy data # sets. Most of the functions should be useful for analysis of # similar-frequency time series
regardless of the subject # matter.
