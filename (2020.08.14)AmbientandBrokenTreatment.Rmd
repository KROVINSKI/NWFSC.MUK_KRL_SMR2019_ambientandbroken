# 1. Setting the Working Directory
1.0
Look for all files inside the Water Chemistry folder of the "06. MOATs replication verification" folder


```{r, setup, include=FALSE }

#### 1.1 Initial Working Directoy

Inside the working directory (folder) is 1 CSV files generated after combining 13CSV logs representing 24second observations. These CSV files were created using the moats graph app

#### 1.1.2 Link to Generating App

[Link to moats.Graph.app](http://github.com/pmcelhany/moatsGraphs.git)
Moving average window (nObs) set to 4. 

#### 1.1.3 Protocol with app

Every 17th observations was selected, the observations were 24second apart. 

#### 1.1.4 App data for 13 MOATS

1 CSVs per moats: M01, M02, M03, M04, M05, M06, M07, M08, M09, M10, M11, M12, M13. Files are also available on the OA Google drive. [OA Drive for MOATS data](https://drive.google.com/open?id=13a2hk1a9I9gRIgf2Xyl1dSYDf5vnyYvs)

### 1.2 Subsampling

For speed and ease of computations the dataframe was extermely subsampled. 
Instead of the standard "n17" used in the aquarium temperature investigation, this document subsampled at "n333".

#### 1.2.1 Subsampling explained by observations

All observations (per the 13 MOATS logs)
[1] 1137880   7 (6 seconds)
Number of observations after subsampling every 17th response/observation
[1] 66934     7 (24 seconds)
Number of observations after the super-subsampling, every 333rd observation
[1] 3417      7 (~30minutes) ***this won't detail the ramp


#### 1.2.2 Subsampling Determination

To examine the Day to Night ramp (D2Nramp) researcher used n17 subsampling group


# 2.0) Calling and Reading in dml
```{r 2.0 Calling and Reading in dml, ECHO= FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, }
#*********************************

#*********************************

# Super Speedy subsampled data
dml <- read.csv(file = "M01thruM13moatslog_n17.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
dim(dml)


```



# 3.0) Reformatting variables/vectors (Factors)

Changing MOATs to Factors for the 13 different MOATs- these will be the discrete units for follow analysis

```{r Reformatting variables/vectors (Factors), ECHO= FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
#*********************************
## 3. Reformatting variables/vectors (Factors) 
#*********************************

## 3.3 Changing variables | 
dml$moats <- factor(dml$moats)
# Checking the names of the different levels
levels(dml$moats)
##checking the dataset, dimensions
dim(dml)
```


# 4.0) Creating dateTime objects  
Changes to the format of dates and times for observations

```{r 4.0 establish the date time object of the CSV, ECHO= FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
dml$dateTime <- as.POSIXct(dml$dateTime, format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%OS")
ReferenceTime <- as.POSIXct("2019-09-20 23:59:00")
class(ReferenceTime)

# QA check
dim(dml)

```

# 5.0) Creating Treatment Variables  

#### 5.1 Three Treatments
Three treatments of this studies are identified as 
* "current" for the Current Conditions Treatment
* "hightemperature" for the High Temperature Conditions Treatment
* "allchange" for the All Change Conditions Treatment which incorporated both the high temperature conditions of the "hightemperature" treatment along with exposure to lower aquariun pH.   

```{r 5.1 Identifying treatments by moats, ECHO= FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## 5.1 Identifying treatments by moats 
## establishing treatments
dml$treatment <- ""
dml$treatment[dml$moats == "M07" | dml$moats== "M10" | dml$moats== "M12"] <- "current"
dml$treatment[dml$moats == "M01"| dml$moats== "M06"] <- "hightemperature"
dml$treatment[dml$moats == "M02"| dml$moats== "M08" | dml$moats== "M13"] <- "allchange"
dml$treatment[dml$moats == "M03"| dml$moats == "M04" | dml$moats == "M09" | dml$moats == "M05" | dml$moats== "M11"] <- "broken_and_ambientbroken"
#verify that this new column has been created
names(dml)
#results should include:
#[1] "moats"        "dateTime"     "aTemperature" "sTemperature" "pH"          
#[6] "DO"           "salinity"     "treatment"  

# QA check
dim(dml)

```

#### 5.1.1 Ambient Treatment
Those MOATS aquarium systems that did not reach desired/programed conditions were deemed the "ambient" treatment. No temperature, DO, or pH conditions were programmed or alarmed. Flow control was governed by a solenoid valve to acheive flow/no-flow, day/night periods. 

MOATS inside the "Ambient" treatment included MOATs 04 and MOATs 05 both were shown to have faulty thermisters. 

Recorded conditions of what the animals experienced can't be guaranteed/confirmed. 

Without a record of aquarium settings MOATs 04 and MOAT 05 data was not included. 



# 6.) Creating Night and Day Periods 

#### 6.1 Narrative (Overall)
Creating a day and night variables 
Day and night periods will only refer to time under treatment as a way to exclude the acclimation period.
Day and night changed at about ~ 1230 on 05OCT19 
Treatment start date considered to begin Monday 23SEP19 at 1200pm
Krill Night Starts 1200 (~1230*) and ends 2100
Krill Days Starts 2101 and ends 1159 (~1229*) 
Interval 1 start 1200 23SEP19, end 1229 05OCT19
Interval 2 start 1230 05OCT19, end 2100 30OCT19

#### 6.2 New Column, New Variable in dml 

```{r 6.2 New Column, New Variable in dml}
## 6.2 New Column, New Variable in dml
#creating a new column, new variable "period"
dml$period <- ""
```

#### 6.3 Disassembling dateTime to create 2 new variables

```{r 6.3 Disassembling dateTime to create 2 new variables}
## 6.3 Disassembling dateTime to create 2 new variables
# Create new split date and time columns
dml$ObservationDate <- as.Date(dml$dateTime)
dml$ObservationTime <- format(as.POSIXct(dml$dateTime) ,format = "%H:%M:%S")
```

#### 6.5 Period Assignments

```{r 6.5 Day / Night Assignments,  ECHO= FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## 6.5 Day / Night Assignments 
# Using the "case_when" function in the tidyverse in the place of a loop
 
dml <- dml %>% mutate(period=case_when(
  (ObservationDate >= "2019-09-23") 
  & (ObservationDate <="2019-10-05") 
  & (ObservationTime >= "12:00:00") 
  & (ObservationTime <="21:00:00") ~"night",
  
  (ObservationDate >= "2019-10-05")
  & (ObservationDate <= "2019-10-30")
  & (ObservationTime >= "12:31:00") 
  & (ObservationTime <="21:00:00") ~"night",
  
  (ObservationDate >= "2019-09-23") 
  & (ObservationDate <="2019-10-05")
  & ((ObservationTime >= "21:01:00") 
     | (ObservationTime <="11:29:00")) ~"day",
  
  (ObservationDate >= "2019-10-05")
  & (ObservationDate <= "2019-10-30")
  & ((ObservationTime >= "21:01:00")
     | (ObservationTime <= "12:01:00")) ~"day",
  
  (ObservationDate >= "2019-09-23") 
  & (ObservationDate <="2019-10-05")
  & ((ObservationTime >= "11:30:00") 
     | (ObservationTime <="12:00:00")) ~"D2Nramp",
  
  (ObservationDate >= "2019-10-05")
  & (ObservationDate <= "2019-10-30")
  & ((ObservationTime >= "12:01:00")
     | (ObservationTime <= "12:30:00")) ~"D2Nramp",

  
  TRUE ~"other"
)

) 
```

#### 6.5.1 Quick Check on Period Generation

```{r 6.5.1 aTemperature Time Series Plots to Invesitgate Different Intervals}
#Quick check to see if periods were created

period.intervals <- ggplot(dml, aes(x=dateTime, y=aTemperature)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour=period, point=))   +
  ggtitle("aTemperature Time Series Plots to Invesitgate Different Intervals") +
  ylim (5.0, 15.00)

period.intervals
```

#### 6.5.1 Quick Check on Day to Night Ramp Verification
The ramp verification will be important to dissolved oxygen verification
Dissolved oxygen not yet shown. 
Recorded dissolved oxygen needs to be corrected with observed salinity. 

The following 2 plots are only present to visualize the different periods across treatments

```{r  6.5.1a Quick Check on Day to Night Ramp Verification}
ggplot(subset(dml, 
               period %in% ("D2Nramp")), 
        aes(x=dateTime, y=aTemperature)) + 
   geom_point(aes(colour=treatment, point=)) +
   ylim (5.0, 15.00) + 
   ggtitle("aTemperature Values, All MOATs, During Day to Night Ramp Period")

```


#### 6.6 Removing the Acclimation Period 
The acclimation and the time after animals were removed from the system was designated other

```{r}

# Removing "other" period from day and night 
# not including acclimation period in this investigation

H2Ochemdf <- dml %>% filter(period != "other")
```
